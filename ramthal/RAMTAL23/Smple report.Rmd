# Introduction

Some text.

## Reg Discontinuity

$$
Y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{Project}_i + \beta_2 \text{DistanceBoundary}_i + \beta_3 Y_{i,t-1} + \sum_{k=1}^8 \gamma_k C_{ik} + \epsilon_i
$$

- $\mathbf{Y_{i,t}}$ is the outcome at endline for farmer $i$ (e.g., drip use, land size, income),
- $\mathbf{Y_{i,t-1}}$ is the *pre-treatment* (baseline) value of the *same* outcome for farmer $i$,
- **Project**$_i$ $=1$ if farmer $i$ lies inside the project area ($0$ otherwise),
- **DistanceBoundary**$_i$: is the distance in meters from the project boundary;
- $\mathbf{C_{ik}}$ ($\mathbf{k=1,\ldots,8}$) are control variables (e.g., farmer age, gender, education, household size, total landholding, caste, baseline income, market distance);
- $\mathbf{\alpha}$ is the intercept, $\mathbf{\beta_j}$ are coefficients of interest, $\mathbf{\gamma_k}$ capture control effects, and $\mathbf{\epsilon_i}$ is an error term.  
  

\underline{\textbf{Control Variables:}}

- **Age:** Continuous variable.
- **Gender:** Binary variable, 1 for male.  
- **Education:** Continuous variable representing years of education [1 = elementary to 6 = high edu].
- **Land holding:** Continuous variable for total agricultural acre of land owned.  
- **House type:** Continuous variable. 1 = pucca, 2 = semi pucca, 3 = kutcha.
- **Jobs other than agriculture:** Continuous variable for total external sources [1â€“4 sources]\footnote{Own non-agricultural business/ Salaried job/ Casual work or daily labor by current household members/ Other jobs or activities}
- **Government pension or scheme:** Binary variable.
- **Rent/lease of property or land:** Binary variable.  
- **Livestock:** Continuous variable for total livestock owned\footnote{\# Cows \# Bullock \# Buffaloes \# Goats and sheep}  
- **Farm equipments:** Continuous variable for total equipments owned\footnote{\# Tractor \# Plough \# Thresher \# Seed drill}
  
  
We estimate an OLS model of the endline outcome $\mathbf{Y_{i,t}}$ on three core regressors plus eight controls. Coefficient  $\mathbf{\beta_1}$captures the average difference in Y for farmers inside versus outside the project area;  $\mathbf{\beta_2}$ measures how Y varies with each additional meter from the project boundary. Importantly,  $\mathbf{\beta_3}$ is on the lagged outcome $\mathbf{Y_{i,t-1}}$, which controls for any baseline level of the same variable (drip use, land size, income, caste group, etc.), thereby isolating the incremental change. Controls $\mathbf{C_{ik}}$ include farmer demographics (age, gender, education), household and farm attributes (household size, total landholding, baseline income).
