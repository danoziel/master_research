```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(ramthal_east_k17$village)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = ramthal_east_k17, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = cropCat)) +
  geom_polygon() +
  geom_path(color = "white", size = 0.2) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank()) +
 # labs(title="Ramthal Micro Irrigation-East Area, Karnataka ",subtitle = "Kharif 2017")+
  labs(x = " ",y = " ")+
  theme_minimal() # +theme(legend.position="none")+ theme(text = element_text(family = "A"))


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
