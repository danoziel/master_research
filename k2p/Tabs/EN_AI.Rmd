## Introduction

This paper explores the initial results from an analysis of self-efficacy, fear of AI-related challenges, and self-image before and after a course that incorporated AI components. The data was collected from students who participated in the course.

## Data Preparation

We begin by loading and preparing the dataset.

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Load the data
Copy_of_english_learning_ai_cleanDF <- read_excel("~/Copy_of_english_learning_ai_cleanDF.xlsx")

# Rename columns for easier reference
english_learning_ai <- Copy_of_english_learning_ai_cleanDF %>%
  rename(
    fearAI_1 = threat_challenge_categoryA_intimidating,
    fearAI_2 = threat_challenge_categoryB_Unpleasant_feeling,
    fearAI_3 = threat_challenge_categoryC_original_Uplifting_challenge,
    fearAI = threat_challenge
  )

# Create a new variable for pre/post-course distinction
english_learning_ai$Post_course <- ifelse(english_learning_ai$Timestamp == "pre_course", 0, 1)

# Show variable names
names(english_learning_ai)




```
